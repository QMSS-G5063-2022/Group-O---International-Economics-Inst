A grant agreement was reportedly signed when China's Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang met with Afghan Minister of Defense Tariq Shah Bahrami on December 27, 2017. However, the monetary value of this grant agreement is unknown. In addition to financing the construction of the training camp, the Chinese Government reportedly agreed to dispatch a battalion of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers (approximately 500 in total) and provide weaponry and training to the Afghan troops stationed there. Afghan General Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, said that the Chinese Government would cover “all material and technical expenses for this base — weaponry, uniforms for soldiers, military equipment, and everything else necessary for its functioning.”  However, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially denied the construction of this training camp in 2018 (most likely because of sensitivities around the idea of China establishing an overseas military ‘base’).

The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, and 5.40 year grace period. The final loan maturity date is March 21, 2038. This project sought to facilitate the acquisition of 1 multipurpose patrol vessel (with a length of 80m, a breadth of 11m, a maximum speed of 20 knots, and an endurance of 5,000 nautical miles) on behalf of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force (Coast Guard), provide lo­gis­tic sup­port for the ac­qui­si­tion of naval as­sets, and provide main­te­nance and train­ing for the ac­qui­si­tion of 12 naval as­sets. China Shipbuilding Trading was the contractor (CSTC) responsible for implementation. The project was successfully completed on September 9, 2015 upon delivery of the multi-purpose patrol vessel. The loan agreement to pay for the vessel was signed after its delivery, and the Chinese government went under contract to deliver the vessel on July 3, 2015. The vessel was dubbed the TTS Nelson (II), replacing an older TTS Nelson that had originally sailed as the HMS Orkney for the British Royal Navy. The original facility was recorded as a member of a group of loans that additionally contained financing from ANSA (valued at $30 million), and ING (valued at $183 million), although these loans were not used for the acquisition of the TTS Nelson (II) but for other Coast Guard purchases. As of March 2018, the Trinidad and Tobago Minister of Finance reported that the outstanding balance of the China Eximbank loan was TT$138,609,487.","1. AidData obtained the commitment date, face value, and borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan from internal records [extracted from the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) and date stamped on March 23, 2020] that the Government of Trinidad and Tobago shared with AidData in March 2020. 2. The China Eximbank loan that supported this project is not included in the China-Latin America Finance Database, co-produced by the Inter-American Dialogue and Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. 3. The loan was originally reported to be valued at $24.2 million.

Few additional details on the facility were publicly provided, and the official statement from the Chinese defense ministry on the meeting did not explicitly mention the facility.DTI will set up Thailand’s first commercial joint defense facility with China in northern Khon Kaen in July 2018, a defense ministry spokesman said.","The exact date of agreement is uncertain.

This followed the signing of a framework agreement between the two parties on October 20, 2016. At the time of the pledge, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Government of the Philippines might use the $14.4 million grant to acquire small arms, fast boats or night-vision goggles. He said ‘[w]e will finalize the deal before the end of the year and a technical working team will soon go [to China] to look at the equipment.” He also indicated that the Government of the Philippines hoped to get the Chinese armaments by the second quarter of 2017. Then, in January 2017, Lorenzana announced that his top priority was to secure speed boats (‘fast boats’) with the $14 million aid package. He also expressed interest in using the funding to acquire drones, bomb disposal equipment, sniper guns, bendable rifles, and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). He indicated that the speed boats would be used for patrolling in Sulu Sea in order to combat piracy and kidnapping. He also said that “We need … RPGs because our enemies are equipped with [them]. In Marawi, the Maute-ISIS have [them], but we don’t.” By text message, Lorenzana told the Manila Times that the Government of the Philippine would receive the RPGs in September 2017 and the speed boats by the end of 2017. Then, on July 29, 2018, the Chinese Government delivered four patrol boats and 30 RPGs (rocket launchers) to the Philippine Navy (PN) as a partial fulfillment of the December 2016 pledge (as captured via Project ID#66016). The military subsequently assigned PN personnel for one week of training on the new equipment's operation and maintenance. Then, on October 29, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of the Philippines signed a formal handover agreement for another batch of 'law enforcement-related materials and equipment' for the Philippine National Police, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Presidential Security Group worth RMB 50 million (as captured via Project ID#66179). This donation was also a partial fulfillment of the December 2016 pledge.","On June 28, 2017, the Chinese Government donated a batch of weapons — including 3,000 rifles (TY-85 7.62 mm sniper rifles, CS/LR4A high precision rifles, and CQ-A5 5.56 automatic rifles) and 6 million pieces of ammunition — worth RMB 50 million (PHP 550 million) to the Government of the Philippines to support its counterterrorism efforts in Marawi City (as captured via Project ID#64162).

Then, on October 1, 2016, the Chinese Government and the Government of Tajikistan signed a grant agreement for the construction of three command centers, five border service outposts, five border service checkpoints and one military training and logistics center along the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. The monetary value of this grant agreement is unknown. The military training and logistics center in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast consists of two dozen two-story buildings and lookout towers. It was opened in 2016 under the name Sitod, which is Tajik for “headquarters.” The purpose of the center is to forestall the prospect of ethnic Uyghur militants trickling across from Afghanistan into western China. Satellite imagery suggests that the center, which is located 14 kilometers from the Afghan border, is equipped with heliports and enough barracks to house a battalion with the support of armored vehicles. It offers a springboard into Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor.

At the time of the pledge, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Government of the Philippines might use the $14.4 million grant to acquire small arms, fast boats or night-vision goggles.

The Chinese Government initially committed RMB 120 million of grant funding in 2016, but through subsequent military aid agreements, it eventually increased its total grant commitment to $28 million. The purpose of the project was to refurbish an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) — commissioned under the name 'SLNS Parakramabahu' — for use by the Sri Lankan Navy. The ship with the Pennant No 625 is 112 meters in length and 12.4 meters in width. It can travel at a maximum speed of 25 knots and it has an endurance of 3500 nm at 18 knots. The ship is a Type 053H2G Jiangwei-I (NATO Codename) class Frigate and it was originally built between 1988 and 1991 in Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. The vessel was commissioned in 1994 as Tongling under Pennant No 542 and was deployed for duties very effectively by the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The refurbished ship was officially handed over to the Sri Lankan Navy on June 5, 2019 at a naval shipyard in Shanghai. The vessel arrived in Colombo Port on July 8, 2019.

52909,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),Djibouti,Africa,2015,No,2016,2017,Chinese Government funds construction of PLA military base in Djibouti (Linked to Project ID#59375),"In June 2015, the Government of Djibouti and the Chinese Government signed an agreement on the establishment of military base in Djibouti. Construction of the heavily fortified naval base began in March 2016. On July 11, 2017, the People's Liberation Army Navy dispatched ships from the South Sea Fleet in Zhanjiang to open the base. Then, on August 1, 2017, the Chinese Government officially inaugurated the PLA Military Support Base in Djibouti. It is is 0.5 square kilometers (0.2 sq mi) in size and staffed by approximately 1,000-2,000 personnel, and has an underground space of 23,000 square meters. The base has a 400 meter runway with an air traffic control tower, as well as a large helicopter apron. The base also houses the PLA Support Base Hospital in Djibouti. The first live fire exercises were conducted on September 22, 2017. Then, around May 2018, the Chinese Government began constructing a large-scale pier (over 330 meters in length or 1,120 feet) at the base, and it appeared to be fully completed after 18 months from a satellite photo taken in December 2019. Satellite analysis also suggests that the Chinese Government may be building a second pier or quay as to increase the naval capacity of the base.The Chinese Government funded the construction of the facility; however, neither the monetary value nor the financial modality used to support this project are known. According to IMF, the agreement signed in June 2015 between the Government of Djibouti and the Chinese Government on the establishment of military base was expected to generate $20 million a year of revenue for the Government of Djibouti (via rental payments).The base is physically co-located with the Port of Doraleh (which was constructed with a $344 million China Eximbank loan, as captured via Project ID#59375) to the west of Djibouti City. To the south of the city are several other foreign military bases, including Camp Lemonnier (United States Navy), Base aerienne 188 (French Air Force), and the Japan Self-Defense Force Base Djibouti. The base is strategically situated by the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Gulf of Aden from the Red Sea and guards the approaches to the Suez Canal.

According to the same source, this project was completed and the equipment was successfully delivered. However, the precise delivery date is unknown. Project ID#72477 and ID#72476 capture additional Chinese Government  grants for the same project. In late 2015, Neil Gibson, a weapons analyst with IHS Jane’s, reported that imagery of Pakistan’s first (Burraq) armed drone suggested it was either a Chinese UAV (the CH-3 UAV) or an indigenous drone based on Chinese technology.

57891,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),Cameroon,Africa,2012,Yes,,2014,"China Eximbank provides EUR 252,450,000 buyer’s credit loan for Patrol Ship Acquisition Project","In 2011, the acquisition of naval patrol ships was proposed after a visit to Cameroon by Hui Liangyu, who was the Chinese vice-premier at the time. Then, during a state by to China by Cameroonian President Paul Biya the same year, some of the specifics of the deal were negotiated. On May 24, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed an EUR 252,450,000 ($330 million) buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Patrol Ship Acquisition Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: 11 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 3% margin. The interest rate that applies to this loan (3.97%) was calculated by taking the average 6-month EURIBOR rate during the month and year (May 2012) when the loan agreement was finalized (0.970%) and adding a 3% margin. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an EUR 300 million commercial (supply) contract between Poly Technologies Inc. and Cameroon's Ministry of Defense, which was signed in October 2013.The purpose of the project was to facilitate the acquisition of two navy patrol vessels (P108 and P109), which were intended to help Cameroon enhance the security of its territorial waters in the area of the Gulf of Guinea. The patrol ships, which were constructed in Qingdao by Poly Technologies Inc., have several floors and they were both outfitted with latest generation of equipment. Each patrol ship can accommodate a crew of 36. These 64-meter vessels are also armed with 76mm PJ26 cannons, based on the Russian AK-176 gun. During the visit of Cameroon’s Defense Minister Edgard Alain Mebe Ngo'o to China on April 24, 2014, he visited Qingdao, where he officially received two new patrol ships at Qingdao shipyard. Both P109 and P108 patrol craft were inducted into the Cameroonian naval fleet. The two patrol ships subsequently arrived in the Cameroonian port of Douala in May 2014. Then, in 2020, the Special Criminal Court of Cameroon indicted Edgard Alain Mebe Ngo'o, the former Minister of Defense, on charges of embezzling 20.37 billion FCFA (nearly EUR 30.5 million). His wife was also charged with aiding and abetting. The couple has been imprisoned since March 2019. Edgard Alain Mebe Ngo'o allegedly accepted large gifts (including an envelope containing EUR 500,000 in cash and expensive clothing) from Poly Technologies Inc. and in exchange approved several military equipment contracts, including the contract for the Patrol Ship Acquisition Project.","1.

1933,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),Tanzania,Africa,2011,No,,2011,PLA provides $3 million grant for National Defence College (NDC) Construction Project,"In 1998, the Tanzania Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF) formed a committee to examine the possibility of establishing a National Defence College (NDC). The committee team underscored the desirability and importance of establishing an NDC. However, it was not easy to establish such an institution at that time due to financial constraints and heavy costs of running the college. In 2008, the idea of establishing a NDC was again revived. The Chinese Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) was approached and they agreed to finance the project with a $3 million grant. The Government of Tanzania contributed 2 billion TZS of local counterpart funding. The project involved the construction of a main academic building, medical center, dining hall, recreational facility, and lodging for the 60 students each year. The NDC is located in the administrative ward of Kunduchi. On January 10, 2011, the newly constructed campus was officially handed over to the TPDF. The handover ceremony was officiated by Tanzania’s Minister of Defence and National Service Dr Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Then, on April 11, 2011 the NDC Faculty — consisting of the Commandant Major General (now Lieutenant General and URT ambassador to Zimbabwe, Charles Lawrance Makakala, three SDS and the College Secretary — were appointed to start preparations for NDC Course 01. On September 10, 2012 Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, the Former President of the United Republic of Tanzania and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces officially inaugurated the College and its First Course.","The National Defence College describes itself as 'a centre of excellence for conducting National Security Studies in a unique and most comprehensive way. It is an inter-services (defence-civil) Government establishment under the Ministry of Defence and National Service. It has been established and mandated to run Security and Strategic Studies Course for senior officers from the Defence, Security Organs and Civil Services. Its aim is to equip Defence and Government policy makers with requisite economic, political, military, scientific, international relations and national organizational knowledge necessary for understanding of national security in its internal and external dynamics. In the forty-seven week training, Course Members are exposed to an integrated multi-dimensional knowledge which enables them to appropriately address challenges impacting on the national security. The NDC also offers an opportunity to those selected senior officers of getting together and exchanging ideas and hence enabling a holistic appreciation of each other’s problems, both in peace and in war. The course therefore builds the capacity of the Course Members for subsequent effective policy making at grand strategic level.'",Completion,Military,Grant,Yes,Military,150,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,People's Liberation Army of China,Government Agency,No,,,,Tanzania People's Defence Forces (TPDF),Government Agency,Recipient,,,,,,,3000000,USD,3204027.984,3000000,,,,1/10/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,1,8,"http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-246046305/chinese-built-defence-college.html|http://ndctz.go.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118&Itemid=105|http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110108e718000m9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=|https://www.dailynews.co.tz/news/tpdf-launches-national-defence-college-in-dar-es-salaam.aspx|http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/27198/Final%20Copy.pdf?sequence=2|https://www.ndctz.go.tz/news/9|https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3vueh44gezwkw4/sw1488355697-history.docx?dl=0|https://www.ndctz.go.tz/pages/history|https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Defence+College/@-6.6662453,39.2044812,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipNFUTbyNhybS0pXPWV3MW05bB-EbUhcRAnTLeQi!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNFUTbyNhybS0pXPWV3MW05bB-EbUhcRAnTLeQi%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i4032!8i3024!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x806a88f3f0b11b9c!8m2!3d-6.6662453!4d39.2044812","Chinese-built defence college to open in Tanzanian capital|About NDC|http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAP00020110108e718000m9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=|TPDF launches National Defence College in Dar es Salaam|The Rise of Chinese Funds to Infrastructure, Trade and  Investment in Tanzania |Peoples Liberation Army Delegation Visit|NDC Tanzania Historical Background|HISTORY |National Defence College",BBC Monitoring Africa|National Defence College||Daily News|University of  Witwatersrand||||Google Maps,"Media Report|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Media Report|Media Report|Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation)|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report",This project involved the construction of a National Defence College in the administrative ward of Kunduchi.

On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Bolivia signed an RMB 716,427,053.03 ($108,729,121.28) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2011) 41 TOTAL NO. (391)] for the 6 H-425 Helicopters Procurement Project. According to the Central Bank of Bolivia, the GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 2% interest rate, 21 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 0.75% commitment fee, and 1% administration (management) fee. The loan agreement was signed into law on March 28, 2012 (Law No. 231). The transaction will mainly be under the executing jurisdiction of the Bolivian Ministry of Defense.The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a a commercial contract with China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) for the acquisition of six, Harbin H-425 helicopters. The helicopters were to be used by the Bolivian Armed Forces to support anti-drug trafficking efforts and promote civil defense. The helicopters can used for day and night operations and they are equipped with meteorological radar and terrain proximity warning equipment. They have the capacity to carry up to 12 passengers and a load of 4 tons. The project also involved the provision of a flight simulator, spare parts, tools and equipment to support the missions (stretchers, rescue crane). Training for pilots, technicians, and maintenance personnel was included as well. CATIC successfully delivered the helicopters to the Bolivian Armed Forces on September 12, 2014, and the helicopters are now based in Chimoré with a maintenance detachment in Cochabamba. However, this project has prompted criticism and controversy. Bolivian legislators have levied complaints about undue influence and inappropriate procurement practices. The Bolivian Armed Forces was also reportedly dissatisfied with the project because of maintenance problems, defective parts, and insufficient training for pilots and maintenance teams.This project is linked to the umbrella project #36006, which seems to be the wider agreement connected to this credit.","1.

68808,No,Yes,China (People's Republic of),Seychelles,Africa,2011,No,2011,2011,China and Seychelles renew Defense Cooperation Agreement (Linked to #68807),"On December 2, 2011, the Chinese Minister of Defense and Seychellois President Michel signed a military cooperation agreement ensuring Chinese assistance in the form of training, equipment, and exchange visits. This is a renewal of a 2004 cooperation agreement (project #68807). Seychelles is strategically located in the Indian Ocean between Asia and Africa attracting piracy activities and therefore threatening China's investments and import-export activities in Africa. On his visit to the island nation, the Chinese Defence Minister General Liang Guanglie was accompanied by a 40-member military delegation. According to an Indian research insitute, a delegation of this size is significant because it suggests China's PLA wants an active presence in Seychelles. At this 2011 meeting, President Michel 'invited' China to establish a military base in Seychelles. However, it is unclear whether this came to fruition since Chinese military analysts later said that their outpost facility did not operate as military base and reaffirmed their policy of not setting up military bases abroad (see: One India, Eurasian Times). Moves like this threaten India's dominance in the Indian Ocean causing India to sign a 20-year pact with Seychelles and build a $550 million USD military base on Assumption Island.

In late 2015, Neil Gibson, a weapons analyst with IHS Jane’s, reported that imagery of Pakistan’s first (Burraq) armed drone suggested it was either a Chinese UAV (the CH-3 UAV) or an indigenous drone based on Chinese technology. ISPR Director General Major General Asim Salim Bajwa announced the first-ever use of the Burraq drone to strike a terrorist compound in Shawal Valley (killing three high-profile terrorists) in September 2015.  The attack was a significant milestone for Pakistan in that it joined the small club of countries with armed drones. The Pakistani Government had previously sought to buy armed drones from the US, but Washington refused to authorize the purchase because of concerns about exporting a sensitive technology.",,Completion,Military,Grant,Yes,Military,150,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,Unspecified Chinese Government Institution,Government Agency,No,,,,Government of Pakistan,Government Agency,Recipient,,,,,,,100000000,CNY,16520993.81,15468960.22,9/26/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,4,https://web.archive.org/web/20170507130714/http://www.ead.gov.pk/ead/userfiles1/file/Trainings/Website%20Year%20Book%202014--15.pdf|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/13/drones-pakistan|https://tribune.com.pk/story/954246/china-supported-designed-or-supplied-pakistans-first-indigenous-drone-claim-analysts|https://www.ft.com/content/6df963c4-576e-11e5-a28b-50226830d644|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESCOM_Burraq,"YEAR BOOK 2014-15|Pakistan developing combat drones|China supported, designed or supplied Pakistan's first indigenous drone, claim analysts|China assisted Pakistan on armed drone, say experts|NESCOM Burraq",GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS DIVISION|The Guardian|Tribune|Financial Times|Wikipedia,Donor/Recipient Official Source|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report,,,,,,Yes,4,3,1,

Harbin Z-9W, or Zhi-9W (?9W), is an attack helicopter produced by HAIG. The Z-9W is an indigenous attack variant of the Z-9 utility helicopter, which itself is a license-built version of the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin. This helicopter can fly at a maximum cruise speed of 238km/h, while carrying external weapons. The ferry range with internal auxiliary tank is 1,000km. The helicopter has an endurance of 3.35 hours.","The Chinese project title is ?-9???????The SAIS-CARI China Loans to Africa database says that this loan financed six helicopters, not eight.

87632,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),Pakistan,Asia,2010,Yes,,,CATIC provides $1.2 billion supplier credit for acquisition of JF-17 fighter jets,"According to the Year Book 2010-2011 published by the Government of Pakistan's Finance Division, the Government of Pakistan finalized a $1.2 billion supplier credit (loan) agreement with China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) during Fiscal Year 2010-2011 to facilitate the acquisition of JF-17 fighter jets. This loan carried an interest rate of 3.99%. The maturity length and grace period of the loan are unknown. The proceeds of the loan were use to finance a commercial contract between Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and CATIC, which was signed in March 2009.  Under the terms of the contract, that parties agreed to co-produce 42 JF-17 Block 1 aircraft. Two serial production aircraft were delivered by CATIC between March and November 2009. Ten JF-17  aircraft were in service as of November 23, 2009. The first JF-17 manufactured JF-17 by PAC handed over to Pakistan’s Air Force on November 23, 2009. The first squadron (No. 26 Black Spiders) was made operational in February 2010 with an initial strength of 14 JF-17 fighters. 18 JF-17 aircraft were in service as of March 2011. The JF-17 made its debut at Farnborough Air Show in 2010, when two JF-17s flew all the way from Pakistan to Farnborough, UK. Four months later in November 2010, three JF-17s flew to China to participate in Zhuhai Air Show, where the aircraft made its first ever aerobatics display. In June 2011, three JF-17s participated in aerobatics and static display in 100-years Celebrations of Turkish Air Force and subsequently three JF-17s also participated in Dubai Air Show in October 2011. At all these Air Shows, the JF-17 attracted intense focus of visitors and international media. The JF-17 Thunder is an all weather, multi-role, light combat aircraft that has the potential to be the main stay & work horse of any Air Force. The design of JF-17 aircraft is based on modern concepts of aerodynamics. The aircraft is equipped with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system that gives it the agility in all regimes of the operational flight envelope. It has a complete glass cockpit, excellent man-machine interface and modern self–protection suite, which enhance combat potential and survivability of the aircraft.

General Ung Samkhan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, as vice-chairman; HE Chea Vandeth, Cabinet Chief and Advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Sok An; and, Por Yutha, Chief of Bilateral Cooperation Office at the Ministry of Economy and Finance — convened to discuss the possibility of acquiring naval patrol ships from China. The Chinese Government subsequently provided a grant worth approximately RMB 333.33 million to the Royal Armed Forces of Cambodia (RAFC) for the acquisition of 6 naval patrol boats. The boats were expected to be used by the RAFC to help its navy branch counter crimes like smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, piracy and terrorism. Another purpose of the project was to safeguard oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Thailand. At the time that the grant was issued, Sihanoukville — Cambodia's only deep-sea port — was expected to become a processing center for oil and natural gas from its 'Block A' chunk in the Gulf of Thailand.  CSSC was the contractor responsible for implementation. The vessels were officially delivered at a handover ceremony that took place on September 1, 2005. In 2005, China Eximbank also provided a loan to the Government of Cambodia for the acquisition of nine additional naval patrol vessels (as captured via Project ID#67969).","1. The Chinese project title is 6????. 2. In 2005, the Cambodian Government used the proceeds of a China Eximbank loan worth RMB 500 million to purchase 9 naval patrol boats from CSSC (as captured via Project ID#67969), which implies that the unit cost of a CSSC naval patrol boat is RMB 55.55 million. Therefore, AidData estimates the value of the grant commitment that supported this project as RMB 333.33 million (RMB 55.55 million x 6).",Completion,Military,Grant,Yes,Military,150,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,China Ministry of Commerce,Government Agency,No,,,,Royal Armed Forces of Cambodia,Government Agency,Recipient,China State Shipbuilding Corporation Limited (CSSC),State-owned Company,China (People's Republic of),,,,333330000,CNY,76625307.18,40681422.29,,,9/1/2005,9/1/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,1,13,https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020050901e191003s7&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=|https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJCFWE0020050708e178004z7&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=|http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sen-secures-400-million-china|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4890400.stm|http://cb.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zxhz/tzdongtai/200509/20050900367723.shtml|https://www.reuters.com/article/cambodia-china/china-gives-cambodia-more-patrol-boats-idUKBKK24806720071025|http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2005-09-02/0804317214.html |https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/government-eyes-chinese-navy-patrol-boats-beat-smugglers|https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-tightening-relationship-with-cambodia/|https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/186810341203100203|https://www.voachinese.com/a/a-21-n2005-09-01-voa61-58366207/1078623.html|https://notip.org.cn/UserImages/00000184.pdf |https://web.archive.org/web/20060418030030/http://abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1451382.htm|https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/cambodia-wants-two-warships-from-china-general-says-108943/,"China donates patrol vessels to Cambodia| DJ China Pledges US$400 Million In Aid, Invest For Cambodia|Hun Sen secures $400 million from China|China gives Cambodia $600m in aid|??6???????? |China gives Cambodia more patrol boats|The Chinese government assists the Cambodian government with 6 maritime patrol boats free of charge|Government eyes Chinese navy patrol boats to beat smugglers|China’s Tightening Relationship with Cambodia|Cambodia–China Relations: A PositiveSum Game? |Beijing presents naval patrol boats to Cambodia|Latest News Digest|China gives Cambodia 6 naval patrol boats|Cambodia Wants Two Warships From China, Admiral Says",BBC||The Phnom Penh Post|BBC||Reuters|Sina News|The Phnom Penh Post |China Brief Volume: 6 Issue: 9|Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs|VOA News|UNIAP China|Radio Australia|The Cambodia Daily,Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Academic Journal Article|Academic Journal Article|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report|Media Report,,,,Hor Namhong,Foreign Minister,Yes,4,5,4,

35332,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),Pakistan,Asia,2005,No,,2013,Chinese Government provides $750 million loan for acquisition of four F-22P frigates (warships) and and six Z-9c helicopters,"In 2003, Pakistan initiated negotiations with China for four frigates (warships). Then, at the 2004 International Defence Exhibition and Seminar (IDEAS), the Chinese side revealed a design for the F-22P frigate that it had proposed to Pakistan’s Navy. The proposed F-22P was a variant of the Type 053H3, but with a heavily reworked superstructure with reduced radar cross-section (RCS) design elements. The Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan reportedly negotiated a $750 million loan non-commercial (i.e. low-cost) terms for the joint manufacture of the warships in September 2004. Pakistan’s Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Admiral Shahid Karimullah, said negotiations were in the “final stages” in December 2004. Then, in October 2005, Pakistan’s Ministry of Defence Production and China Shipbuilding and Trading Company signed a framework agreement for the supply of four F22P frigates (warships) and six Z-9c helicopters with Transfer of Technology (TOT) for use by Pakistan’s Navy. The manufacturing cost of each F22P Frigate — an improved version of China’s original Type 053H3 Frigate — was $175 million. The parties signed a commercial contract in May 2006. A project commencement (‘launching’) ceremony took place on July 4, 2005 and it was attended by the chief of Pakistan Navy, Admiral Shahid Karimullah and senior officials from China's People Liberation Army.  The first Chinese-built F-22 frigate, named PNS Zulfiqar (Arabic for sword), was delivered to Pakistan on July 30, 2009. The second, PNS Shamsheer was handed over on January 23, 2010. The third frigate, PNS Saif, was commissioned on September 15, 2011. The fourth frigate, PNS Aslat, was commissioned on April 17, 2013. The original deal was later expanded to support the construction and acquisition of eight F22P frigates from the Hudong Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai, China, and Karachi shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW), Pakistan. In addition to building eight frigates, the Sino-Pakistan defense deal included the upgrading of the Karachi dockyard for indigenous production of a modern surface fleet.

General Ung Samkhan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, as vice-chairman; HE Chea Vandeth, Cabinet Chief and Advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Sok An; and, Por Yutha, Chief of Bilateral Cooperation Office at the Ministry of Economy and Finance — convened to discuss the possibility of acquiring naval patrol ships from China. Then, on July 4, 2005, China Eximbank and the Royal Armed Forces of Cambodia signed an RMB 500 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Naval Patrol Craft Acquisition Project. The loan carried the following terms:  a 20-year maturity, a 1.75% interest rate, and a 10-year grace period. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), which was signed in December 2005.  The purpose of the project was to facilitate  the acquisition of 9 naval patrol boats. The boats were expected to be used by the Royal Armed Forces of Cambodia (RAFC) to help its navy branch counter crimes like smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, piracy and terrorism. Another purpose of the project was to safeguard oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Thailand. At the time that the loan was issued, Sihanoukville — Cambodia's only deep-sea port — was expected to become a processing center for oil and natural gas from its 'Block A' chunk in the Gulf of Thailand.  CSSC was the contractor responsible for implementation. On July 12, 2005, work on approximately seven naval vessels had already commenced in a Chinese warship factory. On November 7, 2007, CSSC delivered four 46 meter patrol boats, three 20 meter patrol boats, and one landing ship, and one 60 meter floating dock. The equipment handover ceremony was held at the the Ream Navy Headquarters in Sihanoukville, the port city in southwest Cambodia near the Gulf of Thailand. In 2005, the Chinese Government also provided a grant to the Government of Cambodia for the acquisition of six additional naval patrol vessels (as captured via Project ID#32092).","1.
